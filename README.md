# Water Supply & Sewerage Project Manager
/WSS Project Manager/ or WSS for short.

 WSS is a web application developed with Django. The main goal of the application is for clients to create various types of projects, with the data allowing for the calculation of dimensional and parameter details for water supply and sewage systems. For one of the projects, an approximate cost for project execution is calculated based on current prices for materials and labor.

- All calculations are made based on Regulation No. 4 of June 17, 2005, for the design, construction, and operation of building water supply and sewerage installations.
- The prices are approximate averages for the market and depend on various factors such as the materials used, as well as the manufacturing costs of the contracting company chosen for the project.
